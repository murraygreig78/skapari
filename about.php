                            <p>With a passion for Hospitality, Jacky and Riejean strive to create designs that
                                are unobtrusive
                                but individual. Each hotel guest, whether a business traveller or a classical tourist, must feel the
                                attention of the hotel, as though the design was made specifically for them.</p>
                            <p>We start by analyzing the audience. Who will stay in our hotel? It is these people - the clients
                                - that
                                will finally evaluate the results of our work. The history of the place, creating and embracing
                                a sense
                                of locality. A hotel in Lagos, or a hotel in Johannesburg cannot be taken out of the context of
                                their
                                geographical and historical specifics. They have to be and must be different - even if exactly
                                the
                                same type of travellers will stay there. This for us is crucial.</p>
                            <p>After a careful study and understanding of the public and the location, we define the idea of the
                                new project for ourselves, depending on the client’s brief, while time frames and budget
                                determine
                                the specific tasks: what must be done to make the project work. We start seeking specific
                                solutions
                                which need to comply with the functional tasks: ergonomic effectiveness, navigation, logistics,
                                lighting, materials tactile features - which all form the demanding high quality of our
                                interiors.
                                Everything in the hotel needs to be comfortable and user-friendly for the guests. They need to
                                be
                                able to unwind, even if they have business meetings.</p>
                            <p>After solving the functionality, we come to the design itself. The materials that we work with,
                                objèts
                                d’art, juxtaposed combinations - everything should create the mood for guests in harmonious
                                combination with the geography and history of the location. Intimate and intricate layering -
                                creating pockets of interests.</p>
